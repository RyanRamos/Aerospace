  </body>Hello my name is Ryan. This is my about me page for Jillian Ozuna @ STEM Early College High School.
  I am not that sure as to what exactly I need to be writing about for this about me page so I am kinda making it up on the spot.
  I am having a pretty darn good Senior year so far, can't complain. I am 17 years old and am working towards an Engineering degree at Palo Alto College.
  I am also pursuing a career in the US Army in the Intelligence field.

  Here's a nice song to brighten your day!
<p>I wanna double cheeseburger
 <br>
